## Description
A team generator command line application was built for this assignment. The application takes in user's information about their role, and upon completion, an html file is generated that displays each team members information. Every team must have a manager, but you many add as many engineer's or interns as you may like. The application can keep track of who's on your engineering team.

## Installation
1. To run this application, you must have this repository, a terminal, and node installed on your computer.

2. Next, run node app.js on your computer, and fill in the given information when it prompts you to.

## Usage
This is what the questions look like from the prompt.

This is what generated html file looks like when finished.

## Credits
I used the class activities from units 9 and 10 to complete this activity. I also had a tutoring session with my tutor Benjamin Benson to guide me through writing the prompt.
